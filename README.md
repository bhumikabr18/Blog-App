### Description
This Blog Application is a full-stack web project that allows users to register, log in, and manage personal blog posts in a secure and user-friendly environment. The application features complete authentication, including protected routes and token-based access, enabling users to safely create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their content. Public users can explore blog posts created by others, fostering an open content-sharing platform.

The frontend of the application is developed using React, offering a responsive and interactive user interface.
